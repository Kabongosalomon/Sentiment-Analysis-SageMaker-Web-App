# Project Overview

Welcome to the Sentiment-Analysis-SageMaker-Web-App Project. In this project, you'll use Amazon SageMaker,to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model(Deep Learning) which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.
